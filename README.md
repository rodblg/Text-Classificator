# Text-Classificator
In this notebook I took a Kaggle dataset and used a Transformers to extract it´s text embeddings and train a logistic regression algorithm for it´s classification.

The main objective of the Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/overview is to detect when a tweet is real about a disaster, 
so I used the Transformers ability to extract features from real disaster tweets and differentiate the text context to finally train a supervised classification algorithm.
